# Code for predicted relative binding free energy calculations

This repository contains the environment configuration, code, and instructions to reproduce the alchemical free energy calculations used to predict the relative binding free energy change of the HER2 V597M mutation to Trastuzumab. 

## Getting Started 

To reproduce this analysis

1. Clone this repository
